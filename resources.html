A movement is arising, undirected and driven largely by students, to scrub campuses clean of words, ideas, and subjects that might cause discomfort or give offense.”</blockquote>
                                                                        <blockquote>“The current movement is largely about emotional well-being. More than the last, it presumes an extraordinary fragility of the collegiate psyche, and therefore elevates the goal of protecting students from psychological harm. The ultimate aim, it seems, is to turn campuses into “safe spaces” where young adults are shielded from words and ideas that make some uncomfortable. And more than the last, this movement seeks to punish anyone who interferes with that aim, even accidentally.”</blockquote>

                                                                        <blockquote>“First, why is it so hard for us to talk about race?
                                                                                    There are three societal reasons, or barriers, Sue says. ‘First, to preserve harmonious, interpersonal relationships, there are certain topics that are taboo and we have to tiptoe around them in order not to offend others. I call this the politeness protocol. In academia, we also have the academic protocol, which is that you don’t talk about topics that are out of control emotionally because we are told that emotions are antagonistic to reason. And that really is a major barrier because for many, issues of racism, race and identity are deeply personal and emotional. So when you cut off that avenue of feelings, you in essence have cut off the dialogue. And the third reason has to do with the way our society operates. I call it the colorblind protocol. That is, you don’t want to see color because if you do, it may indicate that you are racist and biased.’ ”</blockquote>
                                                                        <blockquote>“ ‘When they talk about race topics, they stutter, they stammer, they tiptoe around them. They become very ambiguous about what they are saying. And contrary to their belief that this makes them appear less racist, studies indicate that when you engage in this tiptoeing, you actually appear more racist to people.’ ”</blockquote>
                                                                        <blockquote>“People of color shouldn’t let themselves off the hook. Consider how you might respond to the earnest efforts of whites you know by asking questions and allowing them to be human, too.”</blockquote>

                                                                                <li><b>Assume good intentions: </b>By emphasizing intentions over impact, this ground rule privileges the intentions of the aggressor over the impact of their behavior on the target. In so doing, it protects aggressors, their feelings, and their lack of accountability; as long as there was no intention to cause harm, you need to let go of the hurt and move on. But from a frame that acknowledges social power, intentions are actually irrelevant; it is impact that matters.</li>
                                                                                <li><b>Speak your truth: </b>I have yet to understand why this seems to be a necessary guideline. I am not aware of a pattern of lying in these groups (defensiveness, distancing, not speaking at all—yes—but not speaking your truth?—no.) More importantly, what if your truth is that you are colorblind? Because no one can actually be colorblind in a racist society, this is not a “truth.” Yet this guideline can function to position all perspectives as equally valid. Given that the goal of antiracist work is to identify and challenge racism and the misinformation that supports it, all perspectives are not equally valid. Some are rooted in racist ideology and need to be uncovered and challenged. We must distinguish between sharing your beliefs so that we can identify how they may be upholding racism, and stating your beliefs as “truths” that cannot be challenged.</li>
                                                                                <li><b>Respect: </b>This problem with this guideline is that respect is rarely defined, and what feels respectful to white people can be exactly what does not create a respectful environment for people of color. For example, white people often define a context in which there is no conflict, no expression of strong emotion, focusing on intentions over impact, and no challenging of racist patterns as respectful, and this is exactly what creates an inauthentic, white-norm centered and thus hostile environment for people of color.</li>

Though it’s less comfortable, Tansey says, naming whiteness and its privileges among white friends, family and colleagues is where the real work needs to be done.”</blockquote>

Blogger Gina Crosley-Corcoran made this point in her blog “Explaining White Privilege to a Broke White Person,” in which she describes the difficult process of identifying with her white privilege because of her low-income upbringing. The same could be true for any white person who has a disability, doesn’t speak English, is undocumented or LGBT—or any combination of the above. Intersectionality does not erase white privilege, but may affect a person’s experience of privilege. ”</blockquote>

                                                                        <blockquote>“White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress be- comes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves.”</blockquote>
                                                                        <blockquote>“It is far more the norm for these courses and programs to use racially coded language such as “urban,” “inner city,” and “disadvantaged” but to rarely use “white” or “over- advantaged” or “privileged.” This racially coded language reproduces racist images and perspectives while it simultaneously reproduces the comfortable illusion that race and its problems are what “they” have, not us.”</blockquote>
                                                                        <blockquote>“This is evidenced through an unracialized identity or location, which functions as a kind of blindness; an inability to think about Whiteness as an identity or as a “state” of being that would or could have an impact on one’s life. In this position, Whiteness is not recognized or named by white people, and a universal reference point is assumed.”</blockquote>
                                                                        <blockquote>“This discourse perverts the actual direction of danger that exists between whites and others. The history of brutal, extensive, institutionalized and ongoing violence perpetrated by whites against people of color—slavery, genocide, lynching, whipping, forced sterilization and medical experimentation to mention a few—becomes profoundly trivialized when whites claim they don’t feel safe or are under attack when in the rare situation of merely talking about race with people of color.”</blockquote>
                                                                    <p><a href="https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/white-fragility-and-the-question-of-trust-wcz/">White Fragility and the Question of Trust</a></p>
                                                                        <blockquote>“Many who are involved in these various aspects of racial justice work will recognize this white call for racial trust, which surfaces in a variety of ways: facilitators devoting time to exercises intended to build trust; creating ground rules to engender trust, and participant justifications for non-engagement (e.g. “I am not going to share because I don’t feel trust here.”) I have tried unsuccessfully to uncover just exactly what my fellow white people mean by the call for trust—what we need to trust will or won’t happen. I am confident the need for trust does not relate to having your wallet stolen or being physically assaulted, although at a subconscious level that may very well be what is at play when the group is racially mixed, given the power of implicit bias and the relentless racist conditioning whites receive. Still, my observations lead me to believe that what it comes down to is this: I need to trust that you won’t think I am racist before I can work on my racism.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>"Because old sh*t is new sh*t. Sometimes it is dormant sh*t. Racism did not go away and then come back because Obama got elected. That is a ridiculous thought. It is like thinking a weed becomes a weed because the sun came out. It is not the sun’s fault that we have weeds in our garden. It is because there are weeds. The only way to get rid of them is to uproot them. Otherwise, they wait for the sun to rise and the water to run so that they can strangle the other plants in the garden."</blockquote>
