								<h4>Why is your project only about conversations on race?</h4>
								<p>Over the past month, I heard this question a lot. From teachers, administrators,
								other students, and even myself. Why did I chose race to be the main focus of my project
								when there are so many other aspect of identity, diversity, and inclusivity that have yet to
								be discussed at Catlin? There are many reasons. The first is simply because it was easy.
								In the past few years we have begun as a school to focus on racial relations and tensions in our society
								both in and out side of the classroom. When I figured out that I wanted to spend the month of May
								figuring out how to improve the "difficult" conversations we have at Catlin, I quickly realized that it would be
								extremely difficult to begin talking about subjects like religion or socioeconomic status or gender identity
								simply because our community has only just begun to think about many oher aspects of identity. In addition,
								I wanted to chose a topic that I felt connected to. While I do have a sexual oreintation, a religion, a class, and a
								gender identity, I have always felt more connected to and passionate about my race than many
								other pieces of me. It has had a larger presence in my life. So, while I recognize that there are so many other
								important conversations our community is still struggling with, I knew that I needed to narrow my scope so I chose
								something that the community was prepared for as well as something that I am very passionate about.</p>
    
                                                                <h4>Why are we <i>still</i> talking about race?</h4>
                                                                <p>A lot of people are in this boat. They understand that race is an important conversation we need to have
                                                                both as a school and as a country, but they don't know why we continue to have this conversation again and again and <i>again.</i>
                                                                I can't answer this question for everyone, but I can answer it for me. Here's the thing,
                                                                as a person of color, I am constantly aware of my race and the race of people surrounding me. It's not
                                                                a tool I use to judge people, but rather as a defense mechanism taught to me as a young child.
                                                                They talked about this in "I'm Not Racist Am I?" Eddie Moore Jr., the facilitator of the conversation
                                                                about the N-Word discussed the importance of the N-Word in today's society, stating that Kahleek could
                                                                die becuase of people's perception of him as an N-Word. Because of this same idea, my parents instilled
                                                                in me, at a young age, the importance of knowing how people percieve you which involves knowing simply who surrounds you.
                                                                As Moore knows and as my parents know, race is an issue of life and death in America. It is the responsibility of the school,
                                                                of Catlin Gabel, to prepare us to enter the world and therefore it is imperative that they instill in us the importance
                                                                of race and our country's need to confront or problems with it. So, instead of asking: <b>"Why do we keep talking about race?" </b>
                                                                You should be asking: <b>"What is it about race that makes me so uncomfortable?"</b> Often it is simply discomfort
                                                                that leads us to deflect. This is simply my take. This is why <i>I </i> think we should should continue
                                                                to talk about race and even do so more. Here are some other takes:</p>
