								</header>
								<p>My goal was to spend the month of May understanding why our school-wide conversations,
								particularly those about race, are often stilted, overly polite discussions that never get to the root
								of the problems. At first, I was worried that students and participants were too afraid of the social
								stigma that could come with being "wrong" or that there was simply a lack of student interest in
								conversations about race. However, in the past few weeks I have found that there are two main
								issues that have been affecting the discussions we have been having. The first issue involved the
								facilitation of difficult conversations, the other is a repressive culture that stemming from fear
								that leads to silence

								
                                                                <h4 id="readMore">Facilitation Issues </h4>
								<p>Many times, in C&Cs, classes, and clubs, teachers are de facto leaders.
								Although teachers are trained to lead classroom discussions, many don't have outside training to
								prepare them for difficult conversations in class. In addition, some classes are geared towards
								conversations about race, while others never or rarely have the opportunity. In addition, with only two professional development days in the school year,
								there are limited opportunities for professional growth in conversations about race. So, what can be
								done to ameliorate the situation for teachers that are struggling or for those who want to dive deeper?
								Diversity & Inclusion, while passions for certain faculty, should be a professional development
								priority for the school. Many teachers have stated that while the school has begun to make efforts
								to engage the entire faculty body, they fall short. In addition to increasing the opportunities for teachers
								who want to go beyond their standard teaching requirements of inclusion, we need to raise the bar for those that don't.
								There should be a common toolbook for teachers, in addition to communal vocabulary, so they know how to engage various audiences
								and know the expectations and standards of the school. For example, in <i> Counseling Today</i>, Derald Wing Sue carefully
								outlines both ineffective and successful strategies for talking about race:<blockquote>                                                                            Five Ineffective Strategies:
                                                                                <ol><li>Do nothing</li>
                                                                                <li>Sidetrack the conversation</li>
                                                                                <li>Appease the participants</li>
                                                                                <li>Terminate the discussion</li>
                                                                                <li>Become defensive</li>
                                                                                </ol>
                                                                            Five Succesful Strategies:
                                                                                <ol><li>Understand your racial/cultural identity</li>
                                                                                <li>Acknowledge and be open to admitting your racial biases</li>
                                                                                <li>Validate and facilitate discussion of feelings</li>
                                                                                <li>Control the process, not the content, of race talk</li>
                                                                                <li>Validate, encourage and express admiration and appreciation to participants who speak when it feels unsafe to do so</li>
                                                                                </ol>
                                                                        </blockquote>
                                                                The strategies laid out by Sue don't have to be the exact ones that we adopt, but they can help guide us towards our own.
                                                                Progress can be made, and we can increase facilitator comfort in conversations about race. We just have to try a bit harder.</p>

                                                                    <p>I believe the first step is for the school to truly prioritize racial equity. One of our school values
								is Diversity & Inclusivity. On our website we state that <a href="http://www.catlin.edu/page.cfm?p=512">We foster an environment in which students
								and adults are curious and supportive, and strive to recognize each person for their unique contributions.</a>
								But we never actually say how we are committed to diversity and inclusivity or what the school is doing
								other than "[recognizing] each person for their unique contributions." So far, we have been having spaces for discussions
								without proper followup or adequate time for progress. One example of this is our viewing and discussion or "I'm Not Racist Am I? After a telling
								conversation in assembly we had C&C time, but 10 minutes is no where near enough time to unpack a movie, let alone a hearty discussion that followed.
								We know this. Juniors watch Citizen Kane with their english classes and have two or so periods for discussion and future opportunities to reflect
								on the movie in tests or an essay if they choose. Yet a movie that is arguably more emotionally charged and intense than Citizen Kane
								according to the student body, numerous faculty discussions, and parent outrage, does not garner more time for
								discussion or further opportunities to reflect? In addition, we watched the movie right before spring break and never looked back. So,
								even though one of the school's core values is diversity and inclusion, we aren't putting in the time.
								</p>


								<h4> Oppressive culture</h4>
                                                                <p>The PC culture in the community comes from a desire to protect members of our community.
								But instead of protecting the constant repression of emotions and feelings lead to a poor culture.
								In conversation, when participants expect everything they say to lead to a lifetime of stigma and or
								being labeled racist or bigot no one says what they mean and we forge community of “yes-men” who only
								agree with the status quo out of fear of repercussions. However, when no one can speak freely there is
								never any opportunity for growth. In the Washington Post, Sydney Trent cites Derald Wing Sue's book, Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender and Sexual Orientation,
								which discusses some of the problems that arise when we try to talk about race: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/03/09/why-americans-fear-talking-about-race-and-how-you-can-lead-the-way/?utm_term=.43b75de369a2"
>								<blockquote>“First, to preserve harmonious, interpersonal relationships, there are certain topics that are taboo and
                                                                we have to tiptoe around them in order not to offend others. I call this the politeness protocol. In academia,
                                                                we also have the academic protocol, which is that you don’t talk about topics that are out of control
                                                                emotionally because we are told that emotions are antagonistic to reason. And that really is a major
                                                                barrier because for many, issues of racism, race and identity are deeply personal and emotional. So when
                                                                you cut off that avenue of feelings, you in essence have cut off the dialogue.”</blockquote> </a> With these protocols in place, no one can make a mistake and
								begin to reflect, anyone who thinks differently might “feel bad.” In addition, feelings bottle up and
								reactionary outbreaks grow larger than necessary. The culture of repercussions and fighting off
								differences only weakens our community and dissuades truthful conversation.</p>

                                                                
								<p>The current issues plaguing community discussions are not unique to Catlin or to Portland but
								they can be improved. Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt observed the same problems nationwide. They comment on the effects of "PC culture" in The Atlantic,
								Stating that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/">The ultimate aim, it seems, is to turn campuses into “safe spaces” where young adults are shielded from words and ideas that make
								some uncomfortable. And more than the last, this movement seeks to punish anyone who interferes with that aim, even accidentally. </a>The first step
								towards improvement is
								to understand where we are. As a community, we value our
								ability to create strong connections and to lean into discomfort. However, we need to take an honest
								look at the kind of culture that surrounds our discussions and decide what we want students to get out of
								their experience here, and if we are willing to sacrifice their comfort to stimulate growth. Secondly, we
								need to decide what we are willing to do. I have sensed a lot of fear and discomfort surrounding race in my
								time here that is holding back facilitators and participants. We must know who we are trying to reach, which
								audience is the most important, and whose apprehension is simply getting in the way of progress. Lastly, as a
								school, we need to set a concrete mission statement concerning race and inclusivity. Often, we use vague and
								timid language to state our commitment to diversity that leaves too much room for inaction. By evaluating our
								current situation and future goals we can outline clear steps for development. </p>
