								<h3>DO</h3>
								    <ul>
									<li>Preface conversations with tools for staying present</li>
									    <p>It is important to set ground rules and communal norms before discussions so that everyone starts on the same page.
									    By doing so, facilitators can decrease discomfort and increase participation. In addition, by starting the conversation
									    with tools for staying present, the amount and scale of emotional reactions can be curbed.</p>
									    <p>see Glenn Singleton's <a href="https://youtu.be/KLsm8h9qSuQ?t=5m4s">Courageous Conversations about Race</a></p>
									<li>Acknowlege who is in the audience</li>
									    <p>While conversations will happen with a group who don't know eachother well, when talking about race, it is 
									    important to recgonize the racial makeup and background of those around. This logic is the same reason we have
									    affinity groups—sometimes it's easier to talk with people that share a similiar background with you. However,
									    when talking with a group of students, knowing who else is participating, and acknowledging different levels of 
									    comfort is essential to leading a menaningful conversation for everyone.</p>
									    <p>see Brooke Barnett and Randy Williams' <a href="http://www.insightintodiversity.com/leading-conversations-about-racism-on-predominantly-white-campuses/">Leading Conversations About Racism on Predominantly White Campuses</a></p>

									<li>Ask followup questions</li>
									    <p>Asking followup questions serves multiple purposes. Facilitators can use this tool to contextualize
									    ideas or to state the importance of a topic. For example, if with the initial question, the participants
									    are able to quickly agree or reach a consensus, by asking a question that changes or complicates the situation,
									    the facilitator can express the complexity or even significance of a problem.</p>
									<li>Allocate enough time for thoughtful conversation</li>
									    <p>Often, conversations run short of time, leaving participants unsatisfied.
									    An easy way to allow conversation to naturally conclude is to narrow the scope of a conversation.
									    Don't have five questions for one short C&C period (I also don't think that C&C is long enough for 
									    discusssion) just focus on one message or quote or question.</p>
									<li>Disagree with ideas and not people</li>
									    <p>Conversations about race are hard. But when people are getting shut down becuse of one comment
									    or idea, honesty is discouraged. When leading conversations, make sure that ideas are being refuted or debated,
									    not people.</p>
									<li>Encourage responses, not reactions</li>
									    <p>In addition to removing people from ideas, conversations should not involve personal reactions to statements
									    but instead have people thoughtfully respond to ideas. This is not saying that facilitators
									    should discourage personal stories—only reactions.</p>
								    </ul>
